# DesktopReminderPet
-------------------------------------------------

I AM NO LONGER WORKING ON THIS. While there is a chance of me contributing to the progress of this project in the far future, I have for now terminated any focus on working towards making this complete or finished. If anyone wants to contribute to helping this become a polished, working Desktop Pet feel free to.

-------------------------------------------------

 A work in progress towards a simple, desktop pet buddy that can give you reminders, whether they're daily or coming up soon. I plan on implementing many tools and features along the way. Also note I'm very new to programming with C# so the code may be a bit messy 
 
 Any contributions are appreciated!
